# Webflow Automation Powerhouse: Zapier & Integromat Integrations Made Easy

Webflow is amazing for building stunning websites, but what if you could connect it to other powerful tools and automate repetitive tasks? That's where Zapier and Integromat come in, acting as your automation superheroes for Webflow. Here's a quick rundown, with a clean code example to get you started:

**1. Zapier & Integromat: Your Automation Dream Team**

Think of them as bridges connecting your Webflow site to a vast world of other services. Zapier focuses on simple, pre-built integrations ("Zaps") with thousands of tools like email marketing, CRMs, and payment gateways. Integromat offers more flexibility and power, allowing you to build complex workflows with custom logic and connections.

**2. Unlocking Automation Potential:**

  - **Form submissions:** Automatically send email notifications, update databases, or trigger actions in other tools when users submit forms on your Webflow site.
  - **New website visitors:** Track website traffic, send personalized messages, or add new leads to your CRM based on user activity.
  - **Data synchronization:** Keep data like product information or customer details consistent across different platforms.
  - The possibilities are endless!

**3. Example (Zapier):**

Let's create a Zap that sends an email notification whenever someone submits a contact form on your Webflow site:

1. In Zapier, choose Webflow as your trigger app and select "New Form Submission" as the trigger event.
2. Choose Gmail as your action app and select "Send Email" as the action.
3. Map the form fields from Webflow (e.g., name, email) to the corresponding email fields in Gmail.
4. Customize the email subject and body with information from the form.
5. Turn on your Zap and watch the magic happen!

**4. Remember:**

- Choose the right tool for your needs and complexity of your workflows.
- Start with simple Zaps or workflows and gradually build on them.
- Test your integrations thoroughly to ensure they function smoothly.

**Bonus Tip:** Explore Webflow's built-in Zapier integration for a seamless and user-friendly setup.
